				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<div class="aboutDescription">
                    <p> Charity Source will provide a fast, efficient way for users to donate to and support their
                        favorite charities throughout the United States. The main goal is to remove the ambiguity of what
                        charities do with the donations they receive. It will also be an easy way to donate to a good cause
                        that will leave people feeling comfortable knowing where their contributions are going. 
                    </p>
